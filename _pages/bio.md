I was born and raised in the beautiful coastal city of Izmir in Turkey. I studied at Izmir Fen Lisesi where I met [my favorite person on Earth](https://ekinakyurek.github.io/). I have taken the nation-wide college admission test and was ranked 31st amid two million exam takers. I moved to Istanbul to study at Koc University and spent five amazing years double-majoring Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Ekin and I married in 2018 and moved to the US where I started my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon. I later moved to Boston to do my PhD in Computer Science at Boston University, working on Natural Language Processing, and graduated in May 2025. I am now a Research Scientist at Scale AI working on LLM post-training.

I am coming from a family of avid travelers and try to keep the spirit alive in the little family of ours 😍🌍🗺️🏝️
