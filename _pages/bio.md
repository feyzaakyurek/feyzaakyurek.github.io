I was born and raised in the beautiful coastal city of Izmir in Turkey. I studied at Izmir Fen Lisesi where I met [my favorite person on Earth](https://ekinakyurek.github.io/). I have taken the nation-wide college admission test and was ranked 31st amid two million exam takers. I moved to Istanbul to study at Koc University and spent five amazing years double-majoring Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Ekin and I married in 2018 and moved to the US where I started my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon. I later moved to Boston to do my PhD in Computer Science, working on Natural Language Processing. I did an internship at Apple, working on gender bias in language models and recently spent some time at Allen AI with the Aristo team where we developed an automatic feedback generator.

I am coming from a family of avid travelers and try to keep the spirit alive in the little family of ours 😍🌍🗺️🏝️
