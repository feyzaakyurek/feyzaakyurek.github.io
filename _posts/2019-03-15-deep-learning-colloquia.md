We attended The Science of Deep Learning Colloquia which is a part of Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia of the National Academy of Sciences,US. We listen mostly high level but motivating and fun talks by leading researchers working on deep learning. We drafted some notes which are very terse and might be inaccurate, but you can get the intuition of the talks. Videos told to be released by two weeks in NAS's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRi55v27uyD31Cp0WwGS5Q">youtube channel</a>.
