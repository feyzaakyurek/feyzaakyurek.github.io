However, neural models perform poorly in settings requiring compositional generalization beyond the training data, particularly to rare or unseen subsequences. Past work has found symbolic scaffolding (e.g. grammars or automata) essential in these settings. We present a family of learned data augmentation schemes that support a large category of compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure. Our approach to data augmentation has two components: recombination of original training examples via a prototype-based generative model and resampling of generated examples to encourage extrapolation. Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a dataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves generalization in two language processing problems, instruction following (SCAN) and morphological analysis (Sigmorphon 2018), where our approach enables learning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples.","tags":null,"title":"Learning to Recombine and Resample Data for Compositional Generalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Garry Kuwanto*","Afra Feyza Akyürek*","Isidora Chara Tourni*","Siyang Li*","Derry Wijaya"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We propose a simple and scalable method to improve unsupervised NMT, showing how adding comparable data mined using a bilingual dictionary along with modest additional compute resource to train the model can significantly improve its performance. We also demonstrate how the use of the dictionary to code-switch monolingual data to create more comparable data can further improve performance. With this weak supervision, our best method achieves BLEU scores that improve over supervised results for English-Gujarati (+18.88), English-Kazakh (+5.84), and English-Somali (+1.16), showing the promise of weakly-supervised NMT for many low resource languages with modest compute resource in the world. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to quantitatively showcase the impact of different modest compute resource in low resource NMT.","tags":null,"title":"Low-Resource Machine Translation Training Curriculum Fit for Low-Resource Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afra Feyza Akyürek","Ekin Akyürek","Derry Wijaya","Jacob Andreas"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Existing approaches to the problem rely on complex model architectures and training procedures that are difficult to tune and re-use. In this paper, we present an extremely simple approach that enables the use of ordinary logistic regression classifiers for few-shot incremental learning. The key to this approach is a new family of subspace regularization schemes that encourage weight vectors for new classes to lie close to the subspace spanned by the weights of existing classes. When combined with pretrained convolutional feature extractors, logistic regression models trained with subspace regularization outperform specialized, state-of-the-art approaches to few-shot incremental image classification by up to 22% on the *mini*ImageNet dataset. Because of its simplicity, subspace regularization can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate additional background information about the new classes (including class names and descriptions specified in natural language); these further improve accuracy by up to 2%. Our results show that simple geometric regularization of class representations offer an effective tool for continual learning.","tags":null,"title":"Subspace Regularizers for Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Afra Feyza Akyürek","Lei Guo","Randa Elanwar","Margrit Betke","Prakash Ishwar","Derry T.
